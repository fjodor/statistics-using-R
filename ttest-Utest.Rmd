## Research Question: Satisfaction with Partnership

* Two independent groups of people in long-term relationships (> 3 years)
* Both get the same question:  
> ***On a scale from 0 to 100,  
> how satisfied are you with your relationship?***

--

.pull-left[
### Group A's Previous Question

> Think of the ***worst experience*** in your relationship.
> On a scale from 0 to 100, how much did it **affect trust** in your partner?
]

--

.pull-right[
### Group B's Previous Q.

> Think of the ***best moment*** in your relationship.
> On a scale from 0 to 100, how much did it **strengthen** your bond?

# Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Tests

.pull-left[
### Parametric: <br>Independent Samples t Test

* Assumes data are on an interval scale
* Assumes data are normally distributed
* Assumes equal variances in groups  
(you can use *Welch* correction in case of unequal variances)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Non-Parametric: <br>Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test = Mann-Whitney U Test

* Uses ranks instead of original data
* Makes no assumption about the underlying distribution
* Recommended if assumptions of t-Test are not met, or sample sizes are small
